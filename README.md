Building Energy Analysis System

Project Overview

This project is a Building Energy Analysis System developed using JavaScript and React for the frontend, along with Node.js and MongoDB for the backend database. The system is designed to calculate heat gain in buildings, estimate energy consumption, and compare energy efficiency between cities.

Features

Login and Registration: Implemented validation for login and registration, though these features are optional.

Heat Gain Calculation: Computes the heat gain of a building based on given parameters.

Energy Consumption Estimation: Calculates energy usage for cooling.

City Comparisons: Allows users to compare the energy efficiency of two cities, such as Bangalore and Mysore, as well as multiple cities.

Frontend-Backend Integration: Ensures seamless data flow between the frontend and backend for efficient analysis and visualization.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js (JavaScript), Material UI

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

State Management: React Hooks


This system provides an interactive dashboard to analyze building energy performance, compare city-wise efficien
